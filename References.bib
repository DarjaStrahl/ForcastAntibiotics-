@article{Dasbas.2016,
 abstract = {Resistance of developed bacteria to antibiotic treatment is a very important issue, because introduction of any new antibiotic is after a little while followed by the formation of resistant bacterial isolates in the clinic. The significant increase in clinical resistance to antibiotics is a troubling situation especially in nosocomial infections, where already defenseless patients can be unsuccessful to respond to treatment, causing even greater health issue. Nosocomial infections can be identified as those happening within 2~days of hospital acceptance, 3~days of discharge or 1~month of an operation. They influence 1 out of 10 patients admitted to hospital. Annually, this outcomes in 5000 deaths only in UK with a cost to the National Health Service of a billion pounds. Despite these problems, antibiotic therapy is still the most common method used to treat bacterial infections. On the other hand, it is often mentioned that immune system plays a major role in the progress of infections. In this context, we proposed a mathematical model defining population dynamics of both the specific immune cells produced according to the properties of bacteria by host and the bacteria exposed to multiple antibiotics synchronically, presuming that resistance is gained through mutations due to exposure to antibiotic. Qualitative analysis found out infection-free equilibrium point and other equilibrium points where resistant bacteria and immune system cells exist, only resistant bacteria exists and sensitive bacteria, resistant bacteria and immune system cells exist. As a result of this analysis, our model highlights the fact that when an individual's immune system weakens, he/she suffers more from the bacterial infections which are believed to have been confined or terminated. Also, these results was supported by numerical simulations.},

From this definition, we argue that Big Data has evolutionary and revolutionary implications for identifying and intervening on the determinants of population health. We suggest that as more sources of diverse data become publicly available, the ability to combine and refine these data to yield valid answers to epidemiologic questions will be invaluable. We conclude that while epidemiology as practiced today will continue to be practiced in the Big Data future, a component of our field's future value lies in integrating subject matter knowledge with increased technical savvy. Our training programs and our visions for future public health interventions should reflect this future.},

@article{Niewiadomska.2019,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Mathematical transmission models are increasingly used to guide public health interventions for infectious diseases, particularly in the context of emerging pathogens; however, the contribution of modeling to the growing issue of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) remains unclear. Here, we systematically evaluate publications on population-level transmission models of AMR over a recent period (2006-2016) to gauge the state of research and identify gaps warranting further work.

METHODS

We performed a systematic literature search of relevant databases to identify transmission studies of AMR in viral, bacterial, and parasitic disease systems. We analyzed the temporal, geographic, and subject matter trends, described the predominant medical and behavioral interventions studied, and identified central findings relating to key pathogens.

RESULTS

We identified 273 modeling studies; the majority of which ({\textgreater} 70{\%}) focused on 5 infectious diseases (human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza virus, Plasmodium falciparum (malaria), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)). AMR studies of influenza and nosocomial pathogens were mainly set in industrialized nations, while HIV, TB, and malaria studies were heavily skewed towards developing countries. The majority of articles focused on AMR exclusively in humans (89{\%}), either in community (58{\%}) or healthcare (27{\%}) settings. Model systems were largely compartmental (76{\%}) and deterministic (66{\%}). Only 43{\%} of models were calibrated against epidemiological data, and few were validated against~out-of-sample datasets (14{\%}). The interventions considered were primarily the impact of different drug regimens, hygiene and infection control measures, screening, and diagnostics, while few studies addressed de novo resistance, vaccination strategies, economic, or behavioral changes to reduce antibiotic use in humans and animals.

CONCLUSIONS

The AMR modeling literature concentrates on disease systems where resistance has been long-established, while few studies pro-actively address recent rise in resistance in new pathogens or explore upstream strategies to reduce overall antibiotic consumption. Notable gaps include research on emerging resistance in Enterobacteriaceae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; AMR transmission at the animal-human interface, particularly in agricultural and veterinary settings; transmission between hospitals and the community; the role of environmental factors in AMR transmission; and the potential of vaccines to combat AMR.},

@article{Ternent.2015,
 abstract = {Bacterial resistance to antibiotic treatment is a huge concern: introduction of any new antibiotic is shortly followed by the emergence of resistant bacterial isolates in the clinic. This issue is compounded by a severe lack of new antibiotics reaching the market. The significant rise in clinical resistance to antibiotics is especially problematic in nosocomial infections, where already vulnerable patients may fail to respond to treatment, causing even greater health concern. A recent focus has been on the development of anti-virulence drugs as a second line of defence in the treatment of antibiotic-resistant infections. This treatment, which weakens bacteria by reducing their virulence rather than killing them, should allow infections to be cleared through the body׳s natural defence mechanisms. In this way there should be little to no selective pressure exerted on the organism and, as such, a predominantly resistant population should be less likely to emerge. However, before the likelihood of resistance to these novel drugs emerging can be predicted, we must first establish whether such drugs can actually be effective. Many believe that anti-virulence drugs would not be powerful enough to clear existing infections, restricting their potential application to prophylaxis. We have developed a mathematical model that provides a theoretical framework to reveal the circumstances under which anti-virulence drugs may or may not be successful. We demonstrate that by harnessing and combining the advantages of antibiotics with those provided by anti-virulence drugs, given infection-specific parameters, it is possible to identify treatment strategies that would efficiently clear bacterial infections, while preventing the emergence of antibiotic-resistant subpopulations. Our findings strongly support the continuation of research into anti-virulence drugs and demonstrate that their applicability may reach beyond infection prevention.},

@article{Urbizu.2018,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE The current diagnostic criterion for Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I), based on tonsillar herniation (TH), includes a diversity of patients with amygdalar descent that may be caused by a variety of factors. In contrast, patients presenting with an overcrowded posterior cranial fossa, a key characteristic of the disease, may remain misdiagnosed if they have little or no TH. The objective of the present study was to use machine-learning classification methods to identify morphometric measures that help discern patients with classic CM-I to improve diagnosis and treatment and provide insight into the etiology of the disease. METHODS Fifteen morphometric measurements of the posterior cranial fossa were performed on midsagittal T1-weighted MR images obtained in 195 adult patients diagnosed with CM. Seven different machine-learning classification methods were applied to images from 117 patients with classic CM-I and 50 controls matched by age and sex to identify the best classifiers discriminating the 2 cohorts with the minimum number of parameters. These classifiers were then tested using independent CM cohorts representing different entities of the disease. RESULTS Machine learning identified combinations of 2 and 3 morphometric measurements that were able to discern not only classic CM-I (with more than 5 mm TH) but also other entities such as classic CM-I with moderate TH and CM Type 1.5 (CM-1.5), with high accuracy ({\textgreater} 87{\%}) and independent of the TH criterion. In contrast, lower accuracy was obtained in patients with CM Type 0. The distances from the lower aspect of the corpus callosum, pons, and fastigium to the foramen magnum and the basal and Wackenheim angles were identified as the most relevant morphometric traits to differentiate these patients. The stronger significance (p {\textless} 0.01) of the correlations with the clivus length, compared with the supraoccipital length, suggests that these 5 relevant traits would be affected more by the relative position of the basion than the opisthion. CONCLUSIONS Tonsillar herniation as a unique criterion is insufficient for radiographic diagnosis of CM-I, which can be improved by considering the basion position. The position of the basion was altered in different entities of CM, including classic CM-I, classic CM-I with moderate TH, and CM-1.5. The authors propose a predictive model based on 3 parameters, all related to the basion location, to discern classic CM-I with 90{\%} accuracy and suggest considering the anterior alterations in the evaluation of surgical procedures and outcomes.},

@article{Volz.2018,
 abstract = {Nonparametric population genetic modeling provides a simple and flexible approach for studying demographic history and epidemic dynamics using pathogen sequence data. Existing Bayesian approaches are premised on stochastic processes with stationary increments which may provide an unrealistic prior for epidemic histories which feature extended period of exponential growth or decline. We show that nonparametric models defined in terms of the growth rate of the effective population size can provide a more realistic prior for epidemic history. We propose a nonparametric autoregressive model on the growth rate as a prior for effective population size, which corresponds to the dynamics expected under many epidemic situations. We demonstrate the use of this model within a Bayesian phylodynamic inference framework. Our method correctly reconstructs trends of epidemic growth and decline from pathogen genealogies even when genealogical data are sparse and conventional skyline estimators erroneously predict stable population size. We also propose a regression approach for relating growth rates of pathogen effective population size and time-varying variables that may impact the replicative fitness of a pathogen. The model is applied to real data from rabies virus and Staphylococcus aureus epidemics. We find a close correspondence between the estimated growth rates of a lineage of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and population-level prescription rates of {\$}$\backslash$$\backslash$beta{\$}-lactam antibiotics. The new models are implemented in an open source R package called skygrowth which is available at https://github.com/mrc-ide/skygrowth.},
